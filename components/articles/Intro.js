        <strong>Why do you ❤ programming?</strong>
        <br />
        It’s those moments when a design, a cleverly CSS template, the customers
        love to use it and feel impressed by this "art", this warm fuzzy feeling
        that comes over you makes it all worth it. To know that this piece of
        "software craftmanship" is about to go live and the world now has a
        little piece of your next cloud native application, whether they know it
        or not. It gives you one of these good days at work and ... the fact,
        it's high scalability and never slow down business growth.

        <br />I love to play table tennis and take pictures.
